# Express Sweater Weather

### About
Express Sweater Weather is a solo project, and my first experience using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and Sequelize. This was very much an exploratory project in which a number of API endpoints were built out to implement CRUD functionality. [Here](https://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/express_sweater_weather/express_sweater_weather_spec) is the link to the original project listing.

**Key Learnings**
* Intro to JavaScript
* Intro to Node.js and Express
* Intro to Sequelize
* Intro to Jest
* Project Management - using a [project board](https://trello.com/b/dv7NzuBG/expresssweaterweather), and breaking down features into multiple user stories.
* Documentation
* Basic CRUD functionality
* Consuming and Producing API's
